# udacity-cloud-developer-deploy-static-website-aws

Files showing that I configured a S3 bucket and cloud front to deploy a static website. Required for the first project of the Udacity Cloud Developer Nanodegree.

You'll find the screenshots about the s3 and cloudfront configurations.
Please go [here](http://reactnd-would-you-rather.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/index.html) to visit the hosted website.

Instead of using the Udacity provided static website, I uploaded a [react website](https://github.com/davidmansy/reactnd-would-you-rather) I developed for the react nanodgree. I will reuse this website as well as I plan to build its back end as capstone project.
